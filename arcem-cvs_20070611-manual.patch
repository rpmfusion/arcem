+<h3>Installation</h3>
+Once installed all versions require a ROM image file, see below
+<ul>
+  <li><b>Unix/X Windows</b>
+    <p>Download the src archive and follow the compilation instructions below.
+      Once compiled copy the arcemrc file to your home directory as .arcemrc.
+      When run there is some output on the console.</p>
+  </li>
+  </li>
+  <li><b>Microsoft Windows</b>
+    <p>Extract the archive and supply a ROM image, the program is called ArcEm.exe. Create a shortcut to this file if you want to add it to your start menu or desktop.</p>
+  </li>
+  <li><b>Mac OS X</b>
+    <p><font color="#FF0000">TODO</font></p>
+  </li>
+  <li><b>RISC OS</b>
+    <p>Please see the !Help file within the !ArcEm application for usage information.</p>
+  </li>
+  <li><b>GP2x</b>
+    <p>Copy the arcemrc and hexcmos files to a folder called 'arcem' on the root of your SD card. Add a 'rom' file here, too.</p>
+  </li>
+  <li><b>Amiga</b>
+    <p>Extract the archive to any directory you choose, just add a file called ROM as described below.</p>
+  </li>
+</ul>
+<hr>
+<a name="compiling">
+<h3>Compiling ArcEm</h3>
+</a>
+<ul>
+  <li><b>Unix/X Windows</b>
+    <p>The X windows version compiles up using the 'Makefile' contained in the
+      root of the source package. If you have a big endian processor, such as
+      Sparc or PowerPC edit the Makefile to add the -DHOST_BIGENDIAN flag to
+      the CFLAGS field. In <font color="#00CC00">CVS</font> versions simply edit
+      the HOST_BIGENDIAN=no to HOST_BIGENDIAN=yes near the top of the Makefile.
+    <pre>
+     make
+   </pre>
+    </p>
+  </li>
+  <li><b>Microsoft Windows</b>
+    <p>ArcEm will build under <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">Cygwin</a>.
+      It builds a version which is independent of Cygwin (unlike the previous
+      version of ArcEm for Windows), so you will also need to ensure you have
+      mingw-runtime library installed (from Cygwin setup). Use the following
+      command:
+    <pre> 
+     make SYSTEM=win
+   </pre>
+    Additionally, ArcEm will build in Microsoft Visual C 6. Project files are
+    provided for this in the 'vc' directory. In <font color="#00CC00">CVS</font> versions
+    there are also project files in 'vc' for Microsoft Studio 2005.
+    </p>
+  </li>
+  <li><b>Mac OS X</b>
+    <p><font color="#FF0000">TODO</font></p>
+  </li>
+  <li><b>RISC OS</b>
+    <p> ArcEm builds with GCC. You should use the following command:
+    <pre>
+     make SYSTEM=riscos-single
+   </pre>
+    It is possible to build with Leo White's RiscXLib if you really want to make
+    an X Windows version under RISC&nbsp;OS, but that is beyond the scope of
+    this guide. Finally, it is also possible to cross compile it using <a href="http://hard-mofo.dsvr.net/gcc/">GCCSDK</a>.
+    e.g.:
+    <pre>
+     CC=/home/riscos/cross/bin/gcc make SYSTEM=riscos-single
+   </pre>
+    The desktop version of ArcEm has not been developed yet, and will not build.
+    </p>
+  </li>
+  <li><b>GP2x</b>
+    <p>The Makefile assumes that you have DevKitGP2X installed in D:/gp2x/<br>
+      You can build by simply:
+    <pre>
+     make SYSTEM=gp2x
+   </pre>
+    </p>
+  </li>
+  <li><b>Amiga</b>
+    <p>You will need the official Amiga OS4 SDK and GCC, then build with the following commands:
+<pre>
+stack 500000
+make SYSTEM=amiga
+</pre>
+   It will not compile with anything other than the OS4 includes. GCC 3.4.4 and 4.0.2 are known to work.
+    </p>
+  </li>
+</ul>

+<a name="using">
+<h3>Using ArcEm</h3>
+</a> <a name="romimages">
+<h4>ROM images</h4>
+</a>
+<p>As ArcEm is only a hardware emulator to make it do anything useful you need
+  an operating system ROM. ArcEm has been tested with and is known to work with
+  ARM Linux, RISC OS 3.10, RISC OS 3.11 and RISC OS 3.19. ARM Linux ROMs are
+  freely available, check the website. RISC OS 3.1x ROMs can be extracted from
+  a real Acorn machine using the following commands on RISC OS.
+<pre>
+       *save :0.$.ROM1 3800000 3880000
+       *save :0.$.ROM2 3880000 3900000
+       *save :0.$.ROM3 3900000 3980000
+       *save :0.$.ROM4 3980000 3a00000
+</pre>
+Copy these files to your host operating system, RISC OS 3.1x supports DOS formatted
+floppy discs so you can use them to transfer the files. ArcEm needs the ROM file
+to be in one part (rather than the 4 you just created) so join them back together
+using this command.
+</p>
+<ul>
+  <li><b>Unix/XWindows</b>
+    <p>From a shell prompt</p>
+    <pre>cat ROM1 ROM2 ROM3 ROM4 &gt; ROM</pre>
+  </li>
+  <li><b>Windows</b>
+    <p>From a cmd.exe command prompt</p>
+    <pre>copy /b ROM1+ROM2+ROM3+ROM4 ROM</pre>

+  <li><b>Amiga</b>
+    <p>From the commandline</p>
+    <pre>join ROM1 ROM2 ROM3 ROM4 as ROM</pre>
+  </li>
+</ul>
+<p>Alternate sources of ROM images, you can download a copy of the RISC OS 3.10
+  ROM image as a support file from the <a href="http://home.tiscali.nl/~jandboer/">!A310emu
+  website</a>, it's in the file <a href="http://home.tiscali.nl/~jandboer/support2.zip">support2.zip</a> and
+  is called ro310, you should rename ro310 to ROM before using it with ArcEm.</p>
+<a name="mouseinput">
+<h4>Mouse Input</h4>
+</a>
+<p>Some of the platforms require specific instructions to let you move the mouse
+  around.</p>
+<ul>
+  <li><b>Unix/X Windows</b>
+    <p>Whilst the Main display window has the focus, press the + key on the numeric
+      keypad to 'capture' the mouse. To 'free' the mouse again for use with the
+      rest of your X desktop press numeric keypad + again.</p>
+  </li>
+  <li><b>Windows</b>
+    <p>Although there is some mouse movement when you move the cursor over the
+      display window, you can use the Unix/XWindows style numeric keypad + toggle
+      to 'capture' and 'free' the mouse for better performance. Currently mouse
+      handling on the Windows build is very poor.</p>
+  </li>
+  <li><b>Mac OS X</b>
+    <p><font color="#FF0000">TODO</font></p>
+  </li>
+  <li><b>RISC OS</b>
+    <p><font color="#FF0000">TODO</font></p>
+  </li>
+  <li><b>GP2X</b>
+    <p><font color="#FF0000">TODO</font></p>
+  </li>
+  <li><b>Amiga</b>
+    <p>The Amiga version runs full-screen and captures all mouse input until you quit the program. You can quit ArcEm from the menu you can bring up with the Left Amiga key.</p>
+  </li>
+</ul>
+<a name="floppies">
+<h4>Using floppies</h4>
+</a>
+<p>All the platforms support using .adf format floppy disc images. A
+  disc image is a binary dump of the contents of a floppy disc. ArcEm has no
+  support for directly using the host computers real floppy disc drive.</p>
+<p>The basic support for floppy discs is to allow you to have the following
+  floppy disc images in the current working directory of the ArcEm executable.<br>
+  FloppyImage0<br>
+  FloppyImage1<br>
+  FloppyImage2<br>
+  FloppyImage3<br>
+  These are then available under RISC OS as the 4 disc drives ADFS:0 to ADFS:3,
+  on Linux they are accessible as <font color="#FF0000">TODO</font>. </p>
+<p>Some platforms provide extra support for using floppy discs.</p>
+<li><b>Unix/XWindows</b>
+  <p>Whilst the control pane window has the focus, pressing 0, 1, 2 or 3 will
+    eject/insert floppy disc images, those images still have to be named as above,
+    but with moving of images around you should be able to change discs at run
+    time.</p>
+</li>
+<li><b>Mac OS X</b>
+  <p><font color="#FF0000">TODO</font> Mention the GUI method of selecting disc images.</p>
+</li>
+<li><b>Amiga</b>
+  <p>A menu to change the disc in drive 0 can be called up with the LAmiga key</p>
+</li>
+<a name="HDimages">
+<h4>Using HD images</h4>
+</a><p>ArcEm supports up to 4 Harddiscs, hard disc images are binary files that represent a hard drive's contents. ArcEm support the ST506 disc interface from Archimedes computers allowing it to support drives up to 64MB in size. Hard drive images should be placed in the current working directory of ArcEm and be named<br>
+HardImage0<br>
+HardImage1<br>
+HardImage2<br>
+HardImage3<br>
+You also need to specify the hard drive "shape" in the arcemrc config file. The "shape" lists the number of Heads, Cylinders, Sectors and the Record Size, these 4 numbers multiplied together are equal to the size in bytes of the hard drive image.</p>
+<p>In RISC OS, you will also need to use the !Configure application to set the number of hard drives inside that OS.</p>
+
+<a name="commandline">
+<h4>Commandline options <font color="#00CC00">CVS</font></h4>
+</a>
+
+<p><font color="#00CC00">CVS</font> versions of ArcEm support commandline options under Unix/X Windows and other platforms.  The Amiga version will also accept them as tooltypes.</p>

+
+<a name="arcemrc">
+<h4>arcemrc file</h4>
+</a>
+<p>The arcemrc files stores information about the number and 'shape' of harddisc's attached to the emulated machine. Here is an example arcemrc:</p>
+<pre>
+MFM disc
+1 1024 8 32 256
+MFM disc
+2 612 4 32 256
+</pre>
+<p>The five numbers represent the following:<br>
+1) Hard drive number: 0 to 3 inclusive.<br>
+2) Number of Cylinders: 1 to 1024 inclusive.<br>
+3) Number of Heads: 1 to 256 inclusive.<br>
+4) Number of Sectors per track: 1 to 256 inclusive.<br>
+5) Sector Length: 256, 512, 1024, 2048, or 4096.<br>
+</p>
+<p>For the premade hard drive images available on the website the shape information should be available. For your own harddiscs that you have imaged you should check the Harddrive itself, as the number of cylinders, sectors and heads is normally printed on it.</p>

+<a name="riscosusage">
+<h4>RISC OS specific Usage</h4>
+</a>
+<p>This section details some of the code that is only relevant when ArcEm is running RISC OS, it does not apply for ARM Linux</p>
+
+<a name="riscosusagehostfs">
+<h5>HostFS <font color="#00CC00">CVS</font></h5>
+</a>
+<p>Make sure the files hostfs,ffa, hostfsfiler,ffa and arcemsupport,ffa are copied or 'sym-linked' from their support_modules sub directories into the 'extnrom' directory.</p>
+<p>Create a directory called 'hostfs' in your executable directory, if it does not exist already. This directory is the root of the 'virtual harddisc'. (You can override this directory and put it in a different place with a commandline option).
+<p>When you boot up RISC OS 3.1x there should be a HostFS icon in the bottom left of the screen, clicking this will open up the host filing system and behaves in the same manner as a real Archimedes harddisc.</p>
+<p>Simply copy files on your host into the hostfs directory and they will be available to RISC OS.</p>
+<p>RISC OS filetypes are written to the host in the style of NFS mounts on Unix with a ,XXX on the end, eg a textfile would appear to be textfile,ffd.</p>
+<p>Files copied into the hostfs directory are unlikely to have their RISC OS filetypes, use the RISC OS 'set type ' function in the filer.</p>
 
-<h2>Contents</h2>
+<p>Known Issues:</p>
+<ul>
+ <li>Does not work at all on Windows/RISC OS/GP2X builds of ArcEm.</li>
+ <li>Files on the host side are not allowed to have dollars in the filename, eg 'textfile$' would not work, but 'textfile' would be fine.
+ <li>Errors that occur when performing actions on the host filing system are often not well reported under RISC OS.</p>
+</ul>
+
+<a name="riscosusagescrollwheel">
+<h5>Mouse Scrollwheel support <font color="#00CC00">CVS</font></h5>
+</a>
+<p>Make sure the file scrollwheel,ffa is copied or 'symlinked' from the 'support_modules/scrollwheel' directory into the 'extnrom' directory.</p>
+<p>Spinning the scrollwheel up and down in RISC OS over windows that are vertically scrollable works in the way you'd expect.</p>

-<h3>Installation and Usage:</h3>
-
-<p>The emulator is initially configured for one MFM hard disc.  If you
-wish to change that, you will need to edit the arcemrc file.</p>
-
-<p>To make a useful program, you will have to add to this the file "ROM"
-containing an Operating System ROM to your OS set up below.  You may also have a
-drive image file named "HardImage1".  This can either usefully be a RISC&nbsp;OS
-filecore image or Linux ext2 image.  Note that RISC&nbsp;OS will quite
-happily boot without a harddrive.</p>
-
-
-<h4>Windows</h4>
-
 <dl>
- <dd>
-  <p><b>Warning: ARM Linux does not currently work in the Windows version
-     of the emulator.  There is an unknown issue with harddrive access.</b></p>
-
-  <p>Unpack the archive to a location of your choice. You should have
-     the following files:</p>
-
-  <ul>
-   <li>index.html, maual.html - Documentation.
-   <li>ArcEm.exe - The emulator itself.
-   <li>hexcmos - CMOS settings for the emulator.
-   <li>arcemrc - Configuration file.
-  </ul>
-
-  <p>The emulator is started by running the executable.  Unfortunately,
-  if anything goes wrong, the emulator will simply quit with little or no
-  warning.  This will be improved in future versions.
-  </p>
-
-  <p>
-  Pressing the + key on the keypad will toggle display of the Windows
-  mouse.

-<h3>Known Issues:</h3>
-
-<ul>
- <li>The only menu item that does anything in Windows is Quit.
- <li>The mouse handling in Windows is rather poor. 
- <li>The Windows version has no diagnostics if anything goes wrong
-     (unless you rebuild with a console).
- <li>The RISC OS version is very slow.
- <li>The X-Windows version has no size handling - you have to resize
-     the window manually.

-<h3>Quick FAQ:</h3>
-
-<p><i><b>Q. Can ArcEm run RISC&nbsp;OS 3.5 or later?</b></i></p>
-
-<p><b>A.</b> No.  ArcEm only emulates Archimedes-style hardware.  RiscPC-style
-hardware is required for RISC&nbsp;OS 3.5 or later.  I have no plans
-to add this, due to the time and research involved, but if someone else
-wanted to, I would be happy to help.</p> 
-
-<p><i><b>Q. Where can I get RISC&nbsp;OS 3.1 ROMs?</b></i></p>
-
-<p><b>A.</b> From your A5000, A3020, etc.  ROM images obtained from
-any other source may be of questionable legality.  This topic has been
-discussed at length in various forums, and will not be repeated here.</p>
-
-<p>To save ROMs from your machine, use four 720K DOS formatted floppies (or
-1.44MB if your machine supports it) and use the following commands for
-each floppy:</p>
-
-<pre>
-       *save :0.$.ROM1 3800000 3880000
-       *save :0.$.ROM2 3880000 3900000
-       *save :0.$.ROM3 3900000 3980000
-       *save :0.$.ROM4 3980000 3a00000
-</pre> 
-
-<p>Finally, ArcEm requires that the ROM image be a single file (unlike
-the other emulators), so concatenate the files using your favourite method
-to produce the final file.
-</p>
-
-
-<p><i><b>Q. It doesn't do anything when it starts/feature X doesn't seem to work?</b></i></p>
-
-<p><b>A.</b> Recompile it with debugging turned on, and find out why.
-I don't have a better answer than that for the time being if you
-can't make it work.</p>
